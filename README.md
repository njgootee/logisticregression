# Logistic Regression implementation in Python
Python implementation of logistic regression algorithm. Used in a data mining project for phishing website prediction. Project for CS 235 at UC Riverside, instructed by Professor Evangelos Papalexakis. Implementation and notebook files, code, and comments are the exclusive work of Nathan Gootee and can be found at https://github.com/njgootee/logisticregression . Collaborative and other group member's work for project is NOT located in this repository.

## Data set
Data set sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/akashkr/phishing-website-dataset .  Feature descriptions can also be found at this webpage.

## Run instructions
To use implementation of LR, simply include in current directory and import file. For example implementation process see phishing_lr.ipynb. To follow implementation as applied to phishing website data set, download files and place in same directory, then open and execute code cells in phishing_lr.ipynb notebook file.
